Yoga Vasistha is not just a theoretical treatise, but also a practical guide for spiritual seekers. It offers various methods and techniques to overcome the obstacles and challenges that one may face on the path of self-realization. Some of the main teachings of Yoga Vasistha are:
 
- The world is an illusion created by the mind. The mind itself is a product of ignorance and attachment. The reality behind the appearance is the supreme Brahman, which is the essence of one's own self.
- The way to realize the truth is to cultivate self-control, inquiry, contentment, and good company. These are the four gatekeepers to the realm of freedom or moksha. They help one to purify the mind and prepare it for higher wisdom.
- The essence of all scriptures is to know one's self as the infinite consciousness that pervades everything. This knowledge alone can destroy the bondage of samsara and grant liberation.
- The course of action for a seeker is to renounce all desires and attachments, practice meditation and devotion, cultivate detachment and discrimination, and surrender to the will of God.

Yoga Vasistha also contains many stories and anecdotes that illustrate these teachings in an engaging and inspiring way. The stories are meant to awaken the intelligence and intuition of the reader, and to show how different people have attained enlightenment in different ways.
